CRITICAL: You MUST respond ENTIRELY in ${langName} language. All text including reasoning_summary, reasoning_signals, source titles, and source descriptions MUST be in ${langName}. Do NOT mix languages.
    
You MUST respond using the suggest_difficulty function with the exact schema provided.

Consider these factors for difficulty assessment:
- Cognitive complexity required
- Prerequisite knowledge needed
- Abstract vs concrete concepts
- Time typically needed to master
- Common student struggles with this topic

CRITICAL - SOURCES REQUIREMENT:
You MUST provide 2-3 REAL educational resources with WORKING URLs. Use these trusted sources:
- Khan Academy: https://www.khanacademy.org/... (for various subjects)
- MIT OpenCourseWare: https://ocw.mit.edu/... (for university-level content)
- Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/... (for online courses)
- edX: https://www.edx.org/... (for online courses)
- Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/... (for general knowledge)
- BBC Bitesize: https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/... (for school subjects)
- CK-12: https://www.ck12.org/... (for K-12 subjects)
- Paul's Online Math Notes: https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/... (for math)
- Physics Classroom: https://www.physicsclassroom.com/... (for physics)

ACCURACY CALCULATION:
The accuracy/confidence score MUST be calculated based on:
1. Quality and specificity of reasoning (30% weight) - How detailed and accurate are the reasons?
2. Number and reliability of sources (40% weight) - Are sources from reputable educational platforms?
3. Alignment between difficulty score and reasoning (30% weight) - Does the reasoning support the difficulty level?

High accuracy (85-100%): Strong reasoning with 3 reliable sources from major educational platforms
Medium accuracy (60-84%): Good reasoning with 2 sources from known platforms
Low accuracy (below 60%): Limited reasoning or sources from less authoritative sources`;

    const userPrompt = `Analyze the difficulty of this study task:
Title: ${taskTitle}
${taskDescription ? `Description: ${taskDescription}` : ""}
${taskSubject ? `Subject: ${taskSubject}` : ""}

Provide a comprehensive difficulty analysis with:
1. Detailed reasoning explaining the difficulty level
2. 2-3 REAL educational resources with WORKING URLs (from Khan Academy, MIT OCW, Coursera, Wikipedia, etc.)
3. Calculate accuracy based on the quality of your reasoning and the reliability of sources

Remember to respond ENTIRELY in ${langName} language.`;
